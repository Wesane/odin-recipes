        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Pizza molded and created by the gods themselves, Odin's pizza is renowned althroughout Olympus.
        <br>It is said that Odin's pizza contains multiple high-quality ingredients, from the blood of giants to 
        <br>the flesh of unicorns. Hades has described the taste of the pizza as "Oddly enamoring". Poseidon, who
        <br> hates pizza, has vouched for the quality of Odin's pizza throughout multiple centuries.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li> 
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li> tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 
            <br>5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed 
            <br>container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.</li>
            <li>Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly 
            <br>dust a pizza peel with flour.</li>
            <li>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 
            <br>14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.</li>
            <li>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper 
            <br>over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then 
            <br>drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.</li>
            <li>With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel easily. Place the tip of 
            <br>the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.
            <li>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface. 
            <br>Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.</li>
            <li>Follow Steps 5 through 9 to make the second pizza.</li>
