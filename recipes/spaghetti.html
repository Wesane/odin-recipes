    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Odin's Special Spaghetti is a special recipe created after Odin watched a sad show. His tears were used
    <br> to boil the water, and the dough was made from the Earth in Olympus. The taste of the spaghetti has 
    <br> been described as "beautifully woesome", the aroma has been said to have enticed Zeus himself.
